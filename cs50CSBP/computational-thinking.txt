### In lecture, we only discussed how to represent positive numbers (and zero) in binary, otherwise known as non-negative numbers.
Propose how you could represent positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero alike in binary. Keep in mind that the only available 
symbols are 0 and 1, no minus symbol from our human world! You're welcome to Google if need be, but first give some thought to the 
problem with the proverbial engineering hat on!

The leftmost binary digit can represent positive (0) or negative (1). We can use a system where the left most number is not counted, 
only indicates positive or negative, or use "two's complement" where the left most number is counted, but if a one is represented as 
a negative digit.

### Write an algorithm (i.e., step-by-step instructions) for something you do every day. Assume that the algorithm will be executed a robot who, unlike a human, cannot "read between the lines," so take care to be precise! An algorithm with 15 â€“ 50 steps is plenty.

### Suppose that an engineer excitedly runs up to you and claims that they've implemented an algorithm that can sort n elements (e.g., numbers) in fewer than n steps. Give some thought as to why that's simply not possible and politely explain.

Steps are required to provide inputs and output, every loop counts as a set of steps so sorting n elements will take at least a few more steps than n. Even the sorting itself requires the algorithm to verify that it has sorted properly on the last loop.

### Suppose that some company has just sent your company a huge list of customers. You respond to that company with a strongly worded note because you only wanted the phone number of one customer, Mike Smith. They, in turn, reply to you suggesting that you simply find him quickly using binary search. Explain why it might not, in fact, be possible to use binary search on the huge list.

More time or memory may be required to search through the long list than is available. 

### Why might a programmer use a "linked list" instead of an "array" to store data in a computer program?

A linked list doesn't require definition of an initial size and items can be added or removed from the middle of the list. Additionally, backtracking is possible in two way linked lists.
