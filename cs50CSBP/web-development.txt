###Recall that we discussed HTTP in the context of internet technologies and HTML in the context of web development. What's the difference between HTTP and HTML?
 
HTTP is a protocol is a responsible for transmitting digital documents such as HTML from servers to browsers. HTML is a markup language that developers use to create web sites and applications for browsers to display.

### Recall that we discussed both HTML and CSS in the context of web development. What's the difference between HTML and CSS?

HTML is the frame of a website, it provides structure whereas CSS applies styling to a site. CSS applies form to HTML's function. That said, CSS3 is very powerful and can be used for transformations and other animations.

### Dive into HTML

For this challenge, you might find it helpful to skim or search http://htmldog.com/guides/html/ and http://htmldog.com/guides/css/, which build upon concepts from lecture.

It's time to make your (first?) website and get acquainted with a web-based IDE (integrated development environment) called CS50 IDE, which is based on open-source software called Cloud9. 

1) Visit https://cs50.io/ and log in.
2) If prompted to create a workspace, select Private and Harvard’s CS50, then click Create workspace.
After a few seconds, you should find yourself in an environment similar to what we used in lecture.
3) In the environment’s “terminal window,” type "update50" (without quotes) and then Enter.
4) Wait a few minutes until your workspace has finished updating itself.
5) Close that terminal window by clicking the X in its tab.

Now let's have you make yourself a web page!

1) Select File > New File within CS50 IDE's interface.
2) Create a super-simple webpage, perhaps identical hello.html from class. For additional inspiration, take a look at the examples from class. If you click a file’s name, you won't see the file’s HTML but a rendered web page instead. To see the web page’s actual HTML, control-click or right-click on the web page’s background and select View Source (if using Chrome) or equivalent.
3) When ready to admire your work, select File > Save and name the file hello.html.
4) In CS50 IDE's lefthand file browser, control- or right-click hello.html, then select Preview.

You should see your page, yes? Drop any of the staff a note if not!

Now let’s have you make an actual website with multiple pages. We’ll leave its design largely up to you, subject only to the following requirements.

i) Your website's main page should live in a file called index.html, since most web servers serve up index.html by default, in the absence of an explicit file name in a URL.
ii) Your website must include a least one other page (with any filename, so long as it ends in .html), and your website's main page (i.e., index.html) must somehow link to that page.
iii) Your website must include at least one image.
iv) Your website must be stylized with at least some CSS, which must live in an "external stylesheet" called styles.css, just as we saw (briefly) in css4.html.
v) Your website should be more complex than those from class (but much less complex than Harvard's home page!). As such, your website should probably use a few dozen HTML tags overall, plus one or more CSS properties.

Alright, make us proud!

If you've any questions along the way, do take advantage of office hours and do reach out to staff!

### What's the URL of your workspace (not website) on Cloud9?
Should resemble https://ide.cs50.io/USERNAME/ide50.
