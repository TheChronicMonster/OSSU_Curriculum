### Suppose that you turn on your computer and visit https://www.harvard.edu/ in a browser. Using each of the terms below in a context 
that makes clear your understanding of each, explain in a paragraph the process by which Harvard's home page appears on your screen: 
DHCP server, DNS server, IP address, packet, TCP port, web server.

DHCP is the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol that acts as a network management protocol on TCP/IP networks. DHCP enables a computer 
to request IP addresses automatically from and ISP (Internet Service Provider). A DHCP server requests information necessary to connect
with Harvard's homepage.

A DNS (Domain Name Server) is a computer server that contains public IP addresses and their associated hostnames. DNS resolves common 
domain names to IP addresses. In this way, when harvard.edu is requested by the browser, the DNS resolves the common name to the harder
to remember numeric IP address.

The aforementioned Internet Protocol address is a numeric label assigned to each device connected to a computer network. IP uses either 
IPv4 or IPv6 protocols, using 32-bit or 128-bit numbers, respectively.
A packet is various byte sized information that transfers over networks from clients to servers and servers to clients. When harvard.edu 
is request, the server responsible for managing harvard's digital information pushes network packets to the requesting machine using the
TCP/IP protocols.

A web server is a system that processes requests over Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to distribute information over the network of 
connected servers known as the internet or World Wide Web.

The web server delivers information from harvard.edu to the requesting computer (client) using HTTP. A client can also transfer 
information to a server using web forms or by uploading files.

### Recall that TCP (tries to) guarantee delivery by ensuring that any lost packets are resent. Why, though, might packets be
lost between a sender and receiver?

There are times when servers become over congested, resulting in packet loss. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) detects packet
loss and performs automatic resubmissions in an effort to deliver 100% of requested information.
Packet loss may be used intentionally as a way to avoid excessive congestion on a server.

### When a server receives a packet, how does it know whether that packet contains (part of) an email, a request for a website, an 
instant message, or something else altogether?

Every network packet contains several bits of data about its contents and other details inside of a header and payload. The header
and payload includes information such as the packet's protocol version number, packet header length, handling instructions, packet 
size (generally 1,500 bytes), unique identifier, where in the data stream the packet belongs, a checksum, source, destination and
optional flags for security, timestamps, and to use strict or loose source routing, as well as the information within the packet.

### In what sense are domain names similar to phone numbers like 1-800-COLLECT?

A number like 1-800-COLLECT is similar to a domain name like harvard.edu in that they are pneumonic representations of a series 
of digits. COLLECT, in this case, represents 2655328 on the telephone and harvard.edu represents the IP address 23.22.75.102.

### If not already familiar, read up on "bandwidth" and "latency" (as via Google) and then, in your own words, distinguish the 
two concepts as they relate to internet speed.

Bandwidth is how many bits can be processed to relay information from a client to a server and back to the client. Latency is 
the time required to deliver information over a network. The more bits in the bandwidth the lesser the latency. Latency can also
be influenced by the way information is transferred (wires or waves) and delays by routers or servers.

### How does every website that you visit know (and likely log!) your IP address?

Every incoming TCP/IP packet contains the origination IP address which is delivered to the web server. A website can deploy
cookies and other tracking scripts to remember an IP address. This can aid in tracking use on a website, or be used to deliver 
targeted advertisements. 

### If not already familiar, read up on "DNS hijacking," as via https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-dns-hijacking/, and in your own
words, explain what it means for an adversary to hijack a website via DNS.

A DNS translates the domain into an IP address and delivers that address to a browser. The DNS is generally controlled by an ISP.
An attacker can corrupt the DNS lookup to change the IP address that a client is sent to. A successful DNS hijacking can occur 
outside of the site's server, attacking weaknesses in the Domain Name System and can result in a user being unknowingly misdirected
to a malicious site.
